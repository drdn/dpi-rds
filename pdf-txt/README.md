# PDF Text Collector Using Python and Textract

Iterates through a directory and creates plain text from .pdf, .doc, .docx, and .html.

### Usage

`python3 pdf-txt.py /path/to/directory`

### Dependencies 

Requires the textract library [https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]().

### To Do

* This script is currently unable to handle files inside sub-directories.
* Some .pdf files do not produce text. This needs to be investigated.
